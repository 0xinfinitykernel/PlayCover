# Source code

On 19th August 2021 some company violated the open source license. Therefore, the public code is temporarily hidden, although it is still available to the most active members of the Discord community. When we develop legal protections, we will reopen the code. Public releases are still available.

# Installation

# How to create key mapping

Press Ctrl + P to open editor mode.

Now you can use Ctrl + N to add button, Ctrl + J - joystick, Ctrl + M - mouse.

To delete a key, click on existing button, and then press Ctrl + Del.

After edit, just press Ctrl + P again to save results.

You can hold Alt during game to stop mouse camera control.
